# Fumblr
#### Fumblr is a Tumblr clone, my favorite blogging platform. On Fumblr, you can create, edit, delete, and search for blog posts!

##### To use Fumblr, users must first register an account. After logging in, users are directed to a dashboard.

##### For the post feature, I utilized the Summernote Text Editor. Using Summernote, users can edit their text and include graphs, images, and videos. I also created an area for tags so users can search for specific posts.

##### For a cleaner user interface, I hid the text editor by default using JavaScript. Once a user clicks the "edit" button, the text editor will appear.
